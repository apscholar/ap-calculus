Welcome to AP Calculus AB and BC. 

Please complete the following items prior to the second day of class:

1. Follow the [College Board instructions](https://collegeboard.org/joinapclass) to join the AP class section for AP Calculus AB or BC. You will receive the join code on the first day of class. The AP class section join codes are different for AB and BC.

2. If you do not already have a Khan Academy account, please [create an account](https://www.khanacademy.org/signup) with your e-mail address. Then [join the Khan Academy class](https://www.khanacademy.org/join) with the Khan Academy class code given to you in class. The Khan Academy class codes are different for AB and BC.

3. Read through the [course syllabus](/syllabus/).

4. Check the [AB course schedule](/ab/) or [BC course schedule](/bc/) and complete any remaining items listed under the first day (Sept. 2). 

  * You should check the schedule regularly for homework and classwork assignments.
  * If I make any changes to the schedules, I will generally make announcements in class and add the changes to the online schedules in a different color.
  * Unless otherwise stated, all items under the "Khan Academy" and "Other Homework" columns are due the following school day. 
  * If you have extra time, you should go through problems listed under the "Classwork" column to prepare for the following day's lesson.
