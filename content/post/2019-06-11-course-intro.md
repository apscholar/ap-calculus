Please complete the following items prior to the second day of class:

1. Follow the [College Board instructions](https://collegeboard.org/joinapclass) to join the AP class section for AP Calculus AB or BC. You will receive the join code on the first day of class. The AP class section join codes are different for AB and BC.

2. Read through the [course syllabus](/syllabus/).

  * Please check the [course schedule](/schedule/) regularly for daily homework assignments.
  * If I make any changes to the schedule, I will generally make announcements in class and add the changes to the online schedule in a different color.
