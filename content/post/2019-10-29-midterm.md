The midterm consists of two parts:

1) 30 multiple-choice questions (front side of answer sheet)

2) 15 short-answer questions (back side of answer sheet)

The midterm will contain topics that we have covered since the start of the school year. These topics include but are not limited to the following:

* Unit circle trig functions, including inverse trig functions
* Limits, including L'Hopital's Rule
* Continuity
* Derivatives (p. 113 - 114 in Barron's)
* Limit definition of derivatives
* Equations of tangent and normal lines of functions
* Derivative of inverse functions
* Mean Value Theorem
* Relative and absolute extrema
* Concavity and inflection points

We are currently covering the final two topics in the list above. For the other topics, please review previous homework assignments to prepare for the midterm. Please note down particular problems that you would like us to cover during our in-class midterm review session at the end of the week.
